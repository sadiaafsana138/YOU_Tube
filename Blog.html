            The scope of var, let, and const.
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-lg">
            In JavaScript, <B>var</B>, <b>let</b> and <b>const</b> are used to declare variables, but they have
            different scopes and behaviors. The scope of a variable refers to where in your code it can be accessed or
            modified. Here's a breakdown of the scope for each of these variable declarations:

            <br><br> <b class="text-lg">1. var: <br>- Function Scope:</b>
            Variables declared with var are function-scoped. This means they are accessible within
            the function in which they are declared, regardless of where in the function they are declared. If a var
            variable is declared within a block , it is hoisted to the top of the
            function or global scope, and this can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior.

            <br><br> <b class="text-lg"> Example:</b>

        <pre>
            function exampleFunction() {
                if (true) {
                var x = 10;
                }
                console.log(x); // 10
                }
           </pre>
        <br><br> <b class="text-lg">2. let: <br>- Block Scope:</b>

        Variables declared with `let` are block-scoped. This means they are only accessible within
        the block (enclosed by curly braces) in which they are declared. This scope behavior is more predictable and
        helps prevent issues like variable hoisting.

        <br><br> <b class="text-lg"> Example:</b>

        <pre>
            function exampleFunction() {
                if (true) {
                let x = 10;
                }
                console.log(x); // Error: x is not defined
                }
         </pre>
        <br><br> <b class="text-lg"> 3. const: <br>- Block Scope:</b>

        const variables also have block scope, just like let. However, const variables cannot
        be reassigned after their initial value is set. This makes them useful for declaring constants or values
        that should not change.

        <br><br> <b class="text-lg"> Example:</b>

        <pre>
            function exampleFunction() {
                if (true) {
                const x = 10;
                x = 20; // Error: Assignment to a constant variable
                }
            }
         </pre>
        In addition to their scope, it's important to note that let and const have a temporal dead zone (TDZ),
        which means they are not accessible before the line of code where they are declared. This behavior helps
        catch errors early and encourages better coding practices.

        In modern JavaScript, it is recommended to use `let` and `const` over `var` because they offer more
        predictable scoping behavior and help prevent common issues associated with `var`. Use `let` when you need
        to reassign a variable, and use `const` when you want to declare a constant value that should not be
        changed.

            The use cases of null and undefined
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-lg">
            <b>null</b> and <b>undefined</b> are two distinct values in JavaScript, and they are often used for different
            purposes. Here are their primary use cases:

        <br><br> <b class="text-lg">1. undefined:
            <br>-Default Value:</b>
            When a variable is declared but not initialized, it is assigned the value undefined by default.

            <br><br> <b class="text-lg"> Example:</b>

        <pre>
            let x;
            console.log(x); // undefined
        </pre>
        <b class="text-lg">-Function Parameters:</b>
        If a function is called with fewer arguments than it has parameters, the missing parameters are set to undefined

            <br><br> <b class="text-lg"> Example:</b>
        <pre>
            function exampleFunction(a, b) {
                console.log(a, b);
              }
              exampleFunction(1); // 1 undefined              
        </pre>
       <b class="text-lg">-Object Properties:</b>
        When you access an object property that doesn't exist, the result is undefined.

            <br><br> <b class="text-lg"> Example:</b>

        <pre>
            const person = {
                name: "John",
                age: 30,
              };
              console.log(person.address); // undefined                          
        </pre>

        <b class="text-lg">1. Null:
            <br>-Explicit Absence of Value:</b>
            null is often used to indicate the intentional absence of any object value or value in general. It signifies that a variable should not reference any object or doesn't have a meaningful value.

            <br><br> <b class="text-lg"> Example:</b>

        <pre>
            let address = null;
        </pre>
        <b class="text-lg">-Clearing Values:</b>
        You can set a variable to null to clear it of any previous value or object reference.
            <br><br> <b class="text-lg"> Example:</b>
        <pre>
            let data = fetchDataFromServer(); // After using the data, clear it to free up memory
            data = null;          
        </pre>
       <b class="text-lg">-As a Sentinel Value:</b>
       Sometimes, null is used as a sentinel value to indicate a special state or condition in the code.

            <br><br> <b class="text-lg"> Example:</b>

        <pre>
            function findElementById(id) {
                if (elementNotFound) {
                  return null;
                }
                // Return the element if found
              }                                    
        </pre>
        In summary, undefined often represents the absence of a value due to uninitialized variables or missing object properties, while null is used to explicitly indicate the absence of an object value or as a way to clear a variable of its previous value. The choice between them depends on the specific use case and coding conventions, but both have distinct roles in JavaScript.

            What do you mean by REST API?
        </h3>
        <br>
        <p class="text-lg">
            <b>REST API,</b> which stands for Representational State Transfer Application Programming Interface, is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It is an approach to building web services that are simple, scalable, and stateless. REST is not a protocol but a set of constraints and principles that developers follow when creating APIs. These principles help in creating web services that are easy to understand, maintain, and consume.

            Key principles and characteristics of RESTful APIs include:

        <br><br> <b class="text-lg">1. Stateless:</b>
        Each request from a client to the server must contain all the information necessary to understand and process the request. The server should not store information about the client's state between requests. This simplifies the architecture and makes it easy to scale.
            <br>
            <b class="text-lg">2.Client-Server Architecture: </b>
            REST separates the client and server, allowing them to evolve independently. This separation promotes a more modular and scalable system.
            <br>
            <b class="text-lg">3.Uniform Interface:</b>
            REST APIs have a consistent and uniform way of interacting with resources, which makes it easy for clients to understand and use the API. This includes using standard HTTP methods like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and using resource URIs to identify resources.
            <br>
            <b class="text-lg">4.Resource-Based: </b>
            In REST, everything is treated as a resource, and each resource is identified by a unique URL or URI. Resources can be data objects, services, or entities.
            <br>
            <b class="text-lg">5.Representation: </b>
            Resources can have multiple representations, such as JSON, XML, or HTML. Clients interact with these representations rather than directly with the resources themselves.
            <br>
            <b class="text-lg">6.Stateless Communication: </b>
            Each request from a client to a server must be self-contained, meaning it should contain all the necessary information to understand and process the request. The server should not rely on any previous requests or client state.
            <br>
            <b class="text-lg">7.Stateless Server: </b>
            The server should not maintain client state between requests. All necessary information should be included in the request.
            <br>
            <b class="text-lg">8.Use of Standard HTTP Methods:</b>
            RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods like GET (for retrieval), POST (for creation), PUT (for update), and DELETE (for removal) to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources.
            <br>
            <b class="text-lg">9.Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS): </b>
            In a fully RESTful API, the responses include links to related resources, allowing clients to navigate the API without prior knowledge of the URLs. This makes the API self-descriptive and flexible.
            <br> <br>
            RESTful APIs are widely used in web development and are often used to build services that provide data and functionality to web and mobile applications. They are known for their simplicity, scalability, and ease of use, and they have become the standard for designing web APIs.
